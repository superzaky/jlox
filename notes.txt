Regarding AstPrinter.java:

expression     → literal
               | unary
               | binary
               | grouping ;

literal        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;
grouping       → "(" expression ")" ;
unary          → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary         → expression operator expression ;
operator       → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
               | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;


A parser really has two jobs:

    1.Given a valid sequence of tokens, produce a corresponding syntax tree.

    2.Given an invalid sequence of tokens, detect any errors and tell the user about their mistakes.
